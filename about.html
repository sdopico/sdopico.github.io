		Hi, I’m Stefani Dopico. Welcome to my official professional presence online.
I’m currently a student at the University of Florida majoring in Telecommunications with a specialization in Media and Society and minoring in English. I have basic skills in coding with HTML5 and CSS, as well as an associate’s certification in using Adobe Premiere Pro 5. In the past, I have won awards for broadcast anchoring and for producing a 30-second commercial on the spot in a group with two strangers from other high schools. These efforts won third and first place, respectively. I’ve also been a member of the Girl Scouts of America since 2001, and have earned both a Bronze Award and Silver Award for my individual community service projects. My hobbies include civil rights activism, blogging, and cats. For more information, please visit my portfolio page to access my resume and links to my official Twitter and LinkedIn pages (which can also be found at the bottom of this page).
